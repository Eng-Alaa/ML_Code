LinearRegression_NormalEquation: estimate the regression model using the normal equation
LinearRegression_GradientDecsent: estimate the regression model using the gradient descent algorithm
PSO_LinearRegression: estimate the regression model using the Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm
GradientDescent.py: This file is used to evaluate the cost function with different weights and plot the cost function

VC_Dimension: This code explains how changing the dimension of the data increases the required weights in linear perceptron algorithm, consequently, increases the complexity of the model, which makes the model need more training data to learn. In this code we tested the training and testing accuracy using different traing sizes.
